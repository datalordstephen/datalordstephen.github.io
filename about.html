            <p>
                I'm a computer science major, and I <b>really like machine learning.</b> 
                I find it pretty freaking cool and it's been my only niche since I got into tech a few years ago.
                <br><br>
                I'm currently diving into the world of LLMs (FINALLY) and reading + watching + coding my way through.
                Other than ml, i've dabbled in a bit of <b>automation with node.js and puppeteer</b> 
                while trying to exploit Virtual Betting with a friend (it did <b>NOT</b> end well :/)
                as well as cool CLI tools like a manga scraper that downloads japanese comics directly to your local machine.
                <br><br>
                I got exposed to programming pretty early, 
                kickstarted the journey with python in 2021 at a tech Academy before resuming uni.
                But as I got into school, the lethal combination that is 
                <i>hefty coursework</i> and <i>crypto/web3</i> made me flunctuate :/.
                <br><br>
                I've gotten back on the grind for half a year now, 
                and i've dabbled in some cool stuff while upskilling myself and becoming a better engineer.
                I'm currently working on a <b>RAG</b> QA system that 
                makes use of a Vector database as a knowledge store.
                Prior to that, I worked on a <b>credit card fraud prediction system</b>
                using classical ML algorithms but took it a bit further
                than your average data science project by contenerizing 
                the entire pipeline with Docker and deploying with FastAPI.
                <br><br>
                Beyond software and AI, I enjoy consuming art in various mediums: 
                movies, anime, books, comics, and music.
                <b>Especially</b> music. I'm a big fan of afrobeats and rap, 
                and I plan to dabble into making music myself someday.
                I also enjoy watching and playing football (<b>Força Barça!!</b>), 
                as well as martial arts (I play Judo)
